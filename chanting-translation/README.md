## Evening End

[S N Goenka: Buddha's Chant As Sung](https://www.movedbylove.org/projects/tunes/143)

"If there is no peace in the minds of individuals, how can there be peace in the world? Make peace in your own mind first"

### Lyrics and translation:

Anicca vata sankhara, uppadavaya-dhammino
Impermanence is the nature of all conditioned phenomenon. They arise and pass away, again and again, with great rapidity.

Uppajjitva nirujjhanti, (2x)
tesam vupasamo sukho.
When past sensations arise and are met with awareness/equanimity, their cessation brings true happiness.

Aneka-jati samsaram
sandhavissam anibbisam,
Through countless births in the cycle of existence
I have run, in vain

Gahakarakam gavesanto
dukkha-jati-punappunam.
seeking the builder of this house; and again and again I faced the discomfort of new birth.

Gahakaraka! Dithosi,
puna geham na kahasi.
Oh housebuilder! Now you are seen.
You shall not build a house again for me.

Sabba te phasuka bhagga,
gahakutam visankhitam.
All your beams are broken, the ridgepole is shattered.

Visankhara-gatam cittam,
tanhanam khayamajjhaga.
The mind has become freed from conditioning; the end of craving has been reached.

Sabbe sankhara anicca'ti.
yada pannaya passati,
Impermanent are all compounded things, when one perceives this with insight.

Atha nibbindati dukkhe.
esa maggo visuddhiya.
then one turns away from suffering; this is the path of purification.

Sabbesu cakkavajesu
yakkha deva ca brahmano,
May the holy entities of all the universes

Yam amhehi katam punnam,
sabba sampatti sadhikam.
rejoice in this wholesome meditation process performed by us, which is productive of all happiness.

Sabbe tam anumoditva,
samagga sasane rata,
May they all, unitedly devoted to the teaching

pamada rahita hontu
arakkhasu visesato.
be without negligence, especially in giving protection.

Punna bhagamidam c'annam,
samam dadama karitam.
We share with all equally the merit of this meditation and other wholesome deeds.

Anumodantu tam sabbe,
medini thatu sakkhike.
May they all accept with joy our sharing, and may the earth stand witness to it!

Bhavatu sabbe mangalam x3
May all beings be happy
