# Vipassana and Metta Bhavana

* [Vipassana Meditation](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index) As taught by S.N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin
  > The technique of Vipassana Meditation is taught at ten-day residential courses during which participants learn the basics of the method, and practice sufficiently to experience its beneficial results. There are no charges for the courses - not even to cover the cost of food and accommodation. All expenses are met by donations from people who, having completed a course and experienced the benefits of Vipassana, wish to give others the opportunity to also benefit.
* [What is Vipassana?](https://www.vridhamma.org/What-is-Vipassana) Vipassana Reserch Institute
  > The technique of Vipassana is a simple, practical way to achieve real peace of mind and to lead a happy, useful life. Vipassana means "to see things as they really are". It is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation.    

## Mr. S.N. Goenka

* [Satya Narayan Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/about/goenka) was the foremost lay teacher of Vipassana meditation of our time. [...]
  > Over a period of almost 45 years, Mr. Goenka and the teachers appointed by him taught hundreds of thousands of people in courses in India and other countries, East and West. Today, meditation centers established under his guidance are operating in Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa and Australasia

  > In spite of this paucity of records from Burma, however, there is evidence that this meditation practice reaches far back into the history of Indian Buddhism.

## Gem Set in Gold

* [Gem Set in Gold a manual of pariyatti containing the P±li and Hindi chanting from a ten-day course of Vipassana Meditation](https://tejash.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gem-Set-in-Gold.pdf) by S. N. Goenka
  > As a teacher, Goenkaji has always given primary importance to paμipatti, the practical aspect, because it is only the experience of truth through systematic self-introspection that can purify the mind and relieve suffering. This is the gem of the Dhamma. Hand in hand with the practice of meditation, however, is the theoretical foundation, like the protective golden setting for a valuable gem. The firm foundation of pariyatti provides the necessary guidance and inspiration for practitioners to take, and keep taking, proper steps on the Path

## Discourses

* [The-Discourse-Summaries](https://archive.org/stream/6.-the-discourse-summaries-english-dana-0-1/6.-The-Discourse-Summaries-English-Dana_0%20%281%29_djvu.txt)
  > The eleven discourses provide a broad overview of the teaching of the Buddha. The approach to this subject, however, is not scholarly or analytical. Instead the teaching is presented in the way that it uníolds to a meditator: as a dynamic, coherent whole. All its different íacets are seen to reveal an underlying unity: the experience of meditation. This experience is the inner fire that gives true life and brilliance to the jewel of the Dhamma. 
  > 
  > Without this experience one cannot grasp the full signiíicance of what is said in the discourses, or indeed of the teaching of the Buddha. But this does not mean that there is no place for an intellectual appreciation of the teaching. Intellectual understanding is valuable as  a support to meditative practice, even though meditation itselí is a process that goes beyond the limits of the intellect.

## Pali Canon

* [The Origin of the Pali Canon](http://www.palicanon.org/) 
  > The authentic teachings of Gotama the Buddha have been preserved and handed down to us and are to be found in the Tipiṭaka. The Pāli word, 'Tipiṭaka', literally means 'the three baskets' (ti=three + piṭaka=collections of scriptures). All of the Buddha's teachings were divided into three parts.
  > 1. The first part is known as the Vinaya Piṭaka and it contains all the rules which Buddha laid down for monks and nuns.
  > 2. The second part is called the Suttaṅta Piṭaka and it contains the Discourses.
  > 3. The third part is known as the Abhidhamma Piṭaka and comprises the psycho-ethical teachings of the Buddha.

  - [Dīgha Nikāya](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/index.html) 
    > The "Long" Discourses (Pali digha = "long") consists of 34 suttas, including the longest ones in the Canon. The subject matter of these suttas ranges widely, from colorful folkloric accounts of the beings inhabiting the deva worlds (DN 20) to down-to-earth practical meditation instructions (DN 22), and everything in between. Recent scholarship suggests that a distinguishing trait of the Digha Nikaya may be that it was "intended for the purpose of propaganda, to attract converts to the new religion." [1]
  - [Majjhima Nikāya](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/index.html)
    > The "Middle-length" Discourses (Pali majjhima = "middle") consists of 152 suttas of varying length. These range from some of the most profound and difficult suttas in the Canon (e.g., MN 1) to engaging stories full of human pathos and drama that illustrate important principles of the law of kamma (e.g., MN 57, MN 86).
  - [Saṃyutta Nikāya](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/index.html)
    > The "Grouped" Discourses (Pali samyutta = "group" or "collection") consists of 2,889 relatively short suttas grouped together by theme into 56 samyuttas.
  - [Aṅguttara Nikāya](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/index.html)
    > The "Further-factored" Discourses (Pali anga = "factor" + uttara = "beyond," "further") consists of several thousand short suttas, grouped together into eleven nipatas according to the number of items of Dhamma covered in each sutta. For example, the Eka-nipata ("Book of the Ones") contains suttas about a single item of Dhamma; the Duka-nipata ("Book of the Twos") contains suttas dealing with two items of Dhamma, and so on.
  - [Khuddaka Nikaya](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/index.html)
    > The "Division of Short Books" (Pali khudda = "smaller," "lesser"), consisting of fifteen books (eighteen in the Burmese edition)
